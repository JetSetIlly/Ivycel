# IvyCel

IvyCel is an experimental spreadsheet-like interface for [Ivy](https://github.com/robpike/ivy).

The initial motivation for the project was the desire for a spreadsheet
application that could handle calculations in binary and hexadecimal without
having to resort to cumbersome function calls.

When I discovered that Ivy handled binary and hexadecimal, I thought it would be
interesting to use it as the engine for such a spreadsheet. Ivycel is the result
of this experimentation

Currently, Ivycel offers the bare minimum functionality that you might expect
from a spreadsheet. The glaring exception to this is the loading and saving of
worksheets. This will follow in a future version.
